Exact transport between the final local row and one earlier row.

This module isolates two logically different statements:

* a genuine compatibility obstruction modulo `gcd Tₚ T_q`, independent of
  the final-row multiplier;
* exact linear normal forms for the remaining multiplier-dependent lift.

No finite census or asymptotic assertion is formalized here.

/-- **Two-row transport.**

If the final row gives `P ≡ c (mod Tq)` and an earlier row, after
multiplication by its prime, gives `Pq ≡ a (mod Tp)`, then their common
reduction forces

`cq ≡ a (mod gcd Tp Tq)`.

Unlike either input row alone, this necessary condition couples the two order
moduli and no longer contains the final-row multiplier. -/

/-- **The third side of the CRT triangle.**

Two earlier rows involving the same product `P * q` must agree after
reduction to the common divisor of their order moduli:

`a ≡ b (mod gcd Tp Tr)`.

Together with the two transports from the final row, this is the complete
pairwise compatibility condition for the three residue classes. -/

/-- **Branch-independent odd shadow of a local row.**

Let `D` be a divisor of the local order on which `p² ≡ 1`.  Then both
possible local residues, `1` and `p²`, collapse to the single Korselt-type
condition `P ≡ 1 (mod D)`.

In the inert Agrawal branch, `D` is the odd part of the order away from `5`;
the structural bound `D ∣ p² - 1` supplies `hp`.  The theorem deliberately
keeps that field-theoretic input separate from its arithmetic kernel. -/

/-- **Shared odd support divides the prime gap.**

If the odd shadows attached to `p` and `r` both divide their complementary
products, then their common part divides `r-p`.  Thus a prime-power component
shared by two local order moduli must also occur in the corresponding gap
between the two prime factors.

This is the incidence form of the third CRT side after the exponents have
collapsed on the odd order support. -/

/-- **Bounded-lift exclusion.**

Two distinct representatives below the modulus cannot be congruent.  In the
fibre audit, `h ≤ H < M` is the exact multiplier interval, while `h₀` is the
canonical solution of the reduced linear congruence.  Thus `H < h₀ < M`
certifies that the row has no admissible lift. -/
